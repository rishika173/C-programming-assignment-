Q1. What do you mean by Structures?


---

Answer:

A structure in C is a user-defined data type that allows you to group variables of different data types under one name.
It helps organize related data together.


---

Syntax:

struct structure_name {
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    ...
};

Example:

#include <stdio.h>

struct Student {
    int id;
    char name[30];
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1 = {1, "Ankit", 85.5};

    printf("ID: %d\n", s1.id);
    printf("Name: %s\n", s1.name);
    printf("Marks: %.2f\n", s1.marks);

    return 0;
}

Output:

ID: 1
Name: Ankit
Marks: 85.50


---

Q2. What do you mean by Array & Pointers Array?


---

Answer:

Array:

An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.

Syntax:

data_type array_name[size];

Example:

int marks[5] = {90, 80, 70, 85, 95};


---

Pointer to Array:

A pointer array is used to store addresses of variables or arrays.

Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20, c = 30;
    int *arr[3];   // array of pointers

    arr[0] = &a;
    arr[1] = &b;
    arr[2] = &c;

    printf("Values using pointer array:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", *arr[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}

Output:

Values using pointer array:
10
20
30


---

Q3. Compare two structure variables using comparison operator (== and !=)


---

⚠️ Note:

You cannot directly compare structures using == or != in C.
Instead, you must compare each member variable manually.


---

Example Program:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Student {
    int id;
    char name[20];
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1 = {1, "Ankit", 85.5};
    struct Student s2 = {2, "Riya", 85.5};

    if (s1.id == s2.id && strcmp(s1.name, s2.name) == 0 && s1.marks == s2.marks)
        printf("Structures are Equal\n");
    else
        printf("Structures are Not Equal\n");

    return 0;
}

Output:

Structures are Not Equal


---

Q4. Perform Arithmetic Operations on Structures


---

Explanation:

You can’t directly perform arithmetic on structures, but you can perform arithmetic operations on structure members (numeric fields inside a structure).


---

Example Program:

#include <stdio.h>

struct Numbers {
    int a;
    int b;
};

int main() {
    struct Numbers n1 = {10, 5};
    struct Numbers result;

    result.a = n1.a + n1.b;
    result.b = n1.a * n1.b;

    printf("Addition: %d\n", result.a);
    printf("Multiplication: %d\n", result.b);

    return 0;
}

Output:

Addition: 15
Multiplication: 50
